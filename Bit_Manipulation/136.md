# Problem

## [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)


# Solution

## 1) Using Sum of Natural numbers Formula - BETTER

      As we know, the sum of first 'n' numbers is n*(n+1)/2.
      Since thae array contains '2n-1' numbers, we store the sum of all these numbers in a variable, say 't'.
      The missing number is n*(n+1) - t.
   
      The only disadvantage in this approach is that, it might lead to integer overflow 
      (e.g) 123628*123629 > INT_MAX (2^31 - 1)
      
      That is why, we use the bit manipualation approach.
   
   
      Time Complexity  : O(N)
                         Since we use a single for loop to add all the 2n-1 numbers.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         No extra space is used in this approach.
                         
               
 
## 2) BIT MANIPULATION, XOR - OPTIMAL

      The XOR of same number twice gives zero.
      Since there are '2n-1' numbers  in the array and only 1 number is missing, XOR of all the elements gives the odd element.
      
      (e.g) If array is [1,2,3,4,1,2,4]
            (1^2^3^4^1^2^4) = (1^1)^(2^2)^(3)^(4^4) = 0^0^3^0 = 3 (Missing Number)
      
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              int singleNumber(vector<int>& v) {
                  int i, n = v.size(), x = 0;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) x ^= v[i];
                  return x;
              }
          };
   
   
      Time Complexity  : O(N)
                         Since we use a single for loop to xor all the 2n-1 numbers.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         No extra space is used in this approach.

## [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/)


# Solution

## 1) Modifying Array to find both the numbers - OPTIMAL

      As we know, the sum of first 'n' numbers is n*(n+1)/2,
      Let's store it in 'b'.
      Also store the sum of all elements in the array in 's'.
      
      Inorder to find the repeating number, we do this modification:
          If the value at v[v[i]-1] is positive, we make it negative.
          Else if it is already negative, that number is the repeating number.
          
      Now that we know the repeating number, finding the missing number is easy.
      We subtract 'a' from 's' and subtract this sum from 'b', which gives the missing number
      
      This approach cannot be applied if we are not allowed to modify the input array.
      That is why, we use the bit manipualation approach.
   
   
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& v) {
                  int a=0, i, n = v.size(), s=0, b = n*(n+1)/2;
                  s = accumulate(v.begin(),v.end(),0);
                  vector <int> ans(2,0);
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) if (v[abs(v[i])-1] > 0) v[abs(v[i])-1] = -v[abs(v[i])-1];
                  else { a = abs(v[i]); break; }
                  ans[0] = a;
                  b = b - (s-a);
                  ans[1] = b;
                  return ans;
              }
          };
          
   
      Time Complexity  : O(N)
                         Since we use for loops to add the array and to modify it.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         No extra space is used in this approach.
                         
               
 
## 2) BIT MANIPULATION, XOR - OPTIMAL

      Let p = 1^2^3^..n
      Let q = a[0]^a[1]^...a[n-1]
      Let r = p^q [this is xor of repeating and missing number]

      Let c = 0 and d = 0
      To find the nos whose bit is set, we take any bit (here let's take right-most bit y = (x & ~(x-1)))
      if (a[i] &  y) c ^= a[i]
      else d ^= a[i]

      To find the one that is repeating and missing, we again do the previous thing from 1 to n (Let it be j)
      if (j &  y) c ^=j
      else d ^= j

      Out of c and d, 1 is repeating and 1 is missing
      To find out we again traverse and find it. 
      
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& v) {
                  int i, n = v.size(), x = 0, z = 0;
                  for (i=1;i<=n;i++) x ^= i;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) x ^= v[i];
                  int y = x & ~(x-1), a = 0, b = 0;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) { if (v[i] & y) a ^= v[i]; else b ^= v[i]; }
                  for (i=1;i<=n;i++) { if (i & y) a ^= i; else b ^= i; }
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) if (v[i] == a) z++;
                  if (z == 2) return {a,b};
                  else return {b,a};
              }
          };
   
   
      Time Complexity  : O(N)
                         Since we use a for loops to compute the answer.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         No extra space is used in this approach.

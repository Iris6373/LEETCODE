## [1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/)
 

# Solution 

## 1) Checking bit-wise - OPTIMAL

      First, we calculate the position of largest set bit among a, b, c.
      This is done inorder to iterate from 0th bit to that set bit (0 to 31 also works).
      If any of a, b, c is a power of 2, then we add 1 to the index of its largest set bit (since total bits from MSB of 2^i = log2(2^i) + 1)
      
      Then we check if the 0th bit of c is set.
      If yes,
          We add 1 to ans, since we change can either ith bit of a or b to make the ith bit of c as 1
      Else
          We check if 0th bit of both a and b are set and add 2 to ans, if so.
          Next we check if 0th bit of either a and b is set and add 1 to ans, if so.
          
          
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
                  int i = 0, x = ceil(log2(a)), y = ceil(log2(b)), z = ceil(log2(c)), ans = 0;
                  if ((a & (a-1)) == 0) x++;
                  if ((b & (b-1)) == 0) y++;
                  if ((c & (c-1)) == 0) z++;
                  while (i < max({x,y,z})) {
                      if ((c&1) == 0) {
                          if ((a&1) == 1 && (b&1) == 1) ans += 2;
                          else if ((a&1) == 1 || (b&1) == 1) ans++;
                      }
                      else {
                          if ((a&1) == 0 && (b&1) == 0) ans++;
                      }
                      i++;
                      a >>= 1;
                      b >>= 1;
                      c >>= 1;
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };  
            
   
    Time Complexity : O(log(N))
                      Since we iterate through all the bits of a, b, c
    Time Complexity : O(1)
                      Since no extra space is used

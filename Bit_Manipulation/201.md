## [201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/)


# Solution 

## 1) Checking total set bits in the range - OPTIMAL

      The binary numbers form 0 to 15 are, 
          0000
          0001
          0010
          0011
          0100
          0101
          0110
          0111
          1000
          1001
          1010
          1011
          1100
          1101
          1110
          1111
          
       As we can see, 
          In the 0th bit, 0 and 1 are alternate.
          In the 1st bit, 2 0's and 2 1's are alternate.
          In the 2nd bit, 4 0's and 4 1's are alternate.
          In the 3rd bit, 8 0's and 8 1's are alternate.
          And so on..
         
       This pattern gets repeated for further bits.
       Thus, if the range right-left+1 > pow(2,i), then there must be atleast 1 no. whose ith bit is zero.
       If right-left+1 <= pow(2,i), then it is sufficient to check if both left and right have their ith bit set.
            This is because they must either fall inside 0's or 1's or in between 0 and 1.
       Thus, we add pow(2,i) to ans.
          
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
                  int i, a, ans = 0;
                  if (left == 0 && right == INT_MAX) return 0;
                  for (i=31;i>=0;i--) {
                      a = (1 << i);
                      if (right-left+1 <= a && (left & a) && (right & a)) ans += a;
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };
            
   
    Time Complexity : O(log(N))
                      Since we iterate through all 32 bits
    Time Complexity : O(1)
                      Since no extra space is used



## 2) Checking equal set bits - OPTIMAL

       A more elegant solution is to make both left and right equal and counting the bits needed to be 
       right-shifted to make it equal.
       
       This works because, the bits right to the equal right bit only differ. 
       For example, 
          9   -  1001
          10  -  1010
          11  -  1011
          12  -  1100
       The bits right to 3rd bit differ and bits left to 3rd bit are same.
       
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
                  int steps = 0;
                  while (left != right) {
                      left = left >> 1;
                      right = right >> 1;
                      steps++;
                  }
                  return left << steps;
              }
          };
            
   
    Time Complexity : O(log(N))
                      Since we iterate through all 32 bits if both numbers are INT_MAX (2^32-1)
    Time Complexity : O(1)
                      Since no extra space is used

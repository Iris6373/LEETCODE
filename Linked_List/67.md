# Solution 

## 1) One Pass - OPTIMAL

       
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
            public:
                string addBinary(string a, string b) {
                    int c = a.size() - 1, d = b.size() - 1, k = 0;
                    string r = "";
                    bool carry = 0;
                    while(k <= c || k <= d) {
                        int val = (k <= c && a[c-k] == '1') + (k <= d && b[d-k] == '1') + carry;
                        r = to_string(val%2) + r;
                        carry = val >= 2;
                        k++;
                    }
                    return (carry ? to_string(carry) : "") + r;
                }
            };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N^2) 
                         Since we add char to start of 'ans' string.
                         This can be reduced by adding at last and reversing which takes O(N) in total.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

# Problem

[89. Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)


# Solution

## 1) My solution

      For n = 1, the sequence is [0,1]
      For n = 2, it is [0,1,3,2]   =>   [0,1,2+1,2+0]
      For n = 3, it is [0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4]   =>   [0,1,3,2,4+2,4+3,4+1,4+0]
      
      As we can see, the gray sequence for 'n' is sequence for 'n-1' + (2^(n-1) added to every number of 'n-1' sequence in reverse order) 
      
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
                  vector <int> ans = {0, 1};
                  int i, j, k, two = 2;
                  i = 0;
                  while (i < n-1) {
                      int j = ans.size()-1;
                      for (int k=j;k>=0;k--) {
                          ans.push_back(two+ans[j--]);
                      }
                      two *= 2;
                      i++;
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };
   
   
      Time Complexity  : O(2^n)
                         Since we use a single for loop to add all the 2^n numbers of the Gray code sequence to the result.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         The space occupied by the output result is not considered in the space complexity analysis. 
                         So overall no extra space is used in this approach.
                         
               
 
## 2) Using Formula

      The Gray code for a decimal number 'n' is n^(n << 1) or n^(n/2)  [Here ^ means XOR]
      
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
                  vector<int> ans;
                  for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
                      ans.push_back(i^(i/2));
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };
   
   
      Time Complexity  : O(2^n)
                         Since we use a single for loop to add all the 2^n numbers of the Gray code sequence to the result.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         The space occupied by the output result is not considered in the space complexity analysis. 
                         So overall no extra space is used in this approach.

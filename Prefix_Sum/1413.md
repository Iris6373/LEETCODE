## [1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum/)


# Solution 

## 1) MINIMUM SUM SUBARRAY - OPTIMAL

     First we need to find the minimum subarray sum (sum) and -1 to it.
     Since step by step sum is never less than 1, we add -1 to sum and multiply sum by -1.
     This is the minimum positive value of startValue.
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int minStartValue(vector<int>& v) {
                int i, sum = v[0], mi = v[0], n = v.size();
                for (i=1;i<n;i++) {
                    mi += v[i];
                    sum = min(sum, mi);
                }
                return (sum > 0) ? 1 : (sum-1)*(-1);
            }
        };

     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we iterate the array once
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since no auxillary space is used.

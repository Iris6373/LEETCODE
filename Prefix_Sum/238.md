## [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)


# Solution 

## 1) PREFIX SUM - OPTIMAL

     First, we can store the product of all elements to the left of current index in the 'ans' array.
     Thus, we have obtained the product of elements to the left.
     Next, for the right-side elements, we muliply the next element of the current index and multiply v[i] with v[i+1] 
     inorder to get the product of all elements to the right of current index so far.
       
     Tis can be also done using a single loop using 2 pointers i(from left) and j(from right) and muliply its neighbours.  
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& v) {
                int i, n = v.size();
                vector <int> ans(n,1);
                for (i=1;i<n;i++) ans[i] *= ans[i-1]*v[i-1];
                for (i=n-2;i>=0;i--) ans[i] *= v[i+1], v[i] *= v[i+1];
                return ans;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we iterate the array twice
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since no auxillary space is used.

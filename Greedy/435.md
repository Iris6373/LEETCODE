# Problem

## [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)


# Solution 

## 1) Sorting + Greedy - OPTIMAL

       First we sort the points vector.
       Next, we check if the current and next point can be merged with some intersection.
       If so, we merge the intersection.
       Else we add 1 to 'ans' and compare the rest using next point.
       Finally, we return n-ans because 'ans' intervals are formed after merging n-ans intervals.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
            public:
                int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
                    sort(points.begin(), points.end());
                    int i, n = points.size(), b = points[0][1], ans = 1;
                    for (i=1;i<n;i++) 
                        if (points[i][0] <= b) b = min(points[i][1], b);
                        else ans++, b = points[i][1];
                    return ans;
                }
            };


 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse all the points once
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

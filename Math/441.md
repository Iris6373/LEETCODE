# Problem Statement

## [441. Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)


## 1) Quadrtic Equation Solution - OPTIMAL

    The answer is positive root of the equation x^2 + x - 2*n = 0.
  
        
   ### Code : (.cpp)  
      
         class Solution {
          public:
              int arrangeCoins(int n) {
                  return (sqrt((long long)8*n + 1)-1)/2;
              }
          };



    Time Complexity  : O(1)
                       Since we only perform an arithmetic operation 

    Space Complexity : O(1)
                       Since no extra space is used

# Problem

## [1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-burgers-with-no-waste-of-ingredients/)


# Solution 

## 1) SIMPLE MATH - OPTIMAL

     Since 1 cheeseSlice is essential for any burger, we subtract 2*cheeseSlice from tomatoSlices.
     This is done to verify whether only Small Burgers can be made.
     
     If the remaining tomatoSlices is zero, we return {0,cheeseSlices}.
     If not, we need to check if the remaining tomatoSlices is greater than 0 and divisible by 2 (If not, it will not become 0) and 
     the new number of Small Burgers (cheeseSlices - remaining_tomatoSlices/2) is greater than 0. 
     Else we return null.
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<int> numOfBurgers(int t, int c) {
                int i = c;
                t -= 2*c;
                c = 0;
                if (t == 0 && c == 0) return {0,i};
                else if (t/2 > 0 && t % 2 == 0 && i-t/2 > 0) return {t/2,i-t/2};
                else return {};
            }
        };

     
     Time Complexity  : O(1) 
                        Since only computations are preformed 
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since no auxillary space is used.

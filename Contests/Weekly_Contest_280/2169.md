# Solution 

## 1) Brute Force

       
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
            public:
                int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
                    int ans = 0;
                    while (num1 && num2) {
                        if (num1 >= num2) num1 -= num2;
                        else num2 -= num1;
                        ans++;
                    }
                    return ans;
                }
            };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since at max we perform N operations.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

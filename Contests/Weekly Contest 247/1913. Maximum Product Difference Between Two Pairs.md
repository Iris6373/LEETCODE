# Problem

[1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/cyclically-rotating-a-grid/)


# My Solution

      Since difference between products of 2 elements should be maximum, we need 2 minimum and maximum elements of the array.
      So, simply we sort the array and return the answer.


   ### Code :

      class Solution {
      public:
          int maxProductDifference(vector<int>& v) {
              int n = v.size();
              sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<int>());
              return v[0]*v[1] - v[n-2]*v[n-1];
          }
      };

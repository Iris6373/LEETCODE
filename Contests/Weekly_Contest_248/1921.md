## [1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters](https://leetcode.com/problems/eliminate-maximum-number-of-monsters/)


# Solution 

## 1) SORTING - OPTIMAL

     We need to compare all the monsters and not according to the order because 
     the monstor with longer disance and speed can reach the city in less time.
     So, we store ceil(d[i]/s[i]) in vector 'a' and sort vector 'a'
     
     And, we check the time taken by each monster with the current time.
     If current time taken <= time taken by monster, we can destroy that monster
     Else we return the number of monsters destroyed so far.
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int eliminateMaximum(vector<int>& d, vector<int>& s) {
                int i, n = d.size(), ans = 0;
                vector <int> a(n,0);
                for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                    a[i] = ceil((double)d[i]/s[i]);
                }
                sort(a.begin(),a.end());
                for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                    if (a[i] > i) ans++;
                    else return ans;
                }
                return ans;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N*log(N)) 
                        Since sorting takes linarithmetic time
     Space Complexity : O(N)
                        Since vector 'a' is used to store the time taken by each monster

# Problem

## [1920. Build Array from Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/)


# Solution 

## 1) SIMPLE APPLICATION - BETTER

     For every element
        a[i] = v[v[i]
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& v) {
                int i, n = v.size();
                vector <int> a(n,0);
                for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                    a[i] = v[v[i]];
                }
                return a;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we traverse through the array
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since space used for the output is not counted towards the space complexity.

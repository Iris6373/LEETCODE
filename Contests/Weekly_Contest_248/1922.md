# Solution 

## 1) BINARY EXPONENTATION WITH MODULO ARITHMETIC - OPTIMAL

     The even indices can have digits - 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
     The odd indices can have digits - 2, 3, 5, 7
     
     Since an even index has 5 choices and odd has 4, 
     then the total number of good digits is 5^((n+1)/2))*4^(n- (n+1)/2)) 
     (n+1)/2 is used to deal with odd n, which has more 5's than 4's 
     
     But the answer is too big, that we can't multiply 5 and 4 every time and take modulo.
     Thus, we use Binary Exponentation to speed up the process.
     
         Let's consider res = a^b and a = 1 (initially, res = 1)
         The algorithm is,
              while b > 0
                  If n is odd, we multiply a to res 
                  Multiply a by a
                  Divide b by 2

         To find a^b % mod, we simply need to include %m after every multiplication.
         
      Thus, we find 5^((n+1)/2)) and 4^(n- (n+1)/2)) separately, and multiply both (and take mod) to return the result. 
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
                long long res1 = 1, res2 = 1, res = 1, a = 5, b = (n+1)/2, m = 1e9+7;
                while (b > 0) {
                    if (b & 1)
                        res1 = res1 * a % m;
                    a = a * a % m;
                    b >>= 1;
                }
                a = 4;
                b = n - (n+1)/2;
                while (b > 0) {
                    if (b & 1)
                        res2 = res2 * a % m;
                    a = a * a % m;
                    b >>= 1;
                }
                res = (res1*res2) % m;
                return res;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(log(N)) 
                        Since we have to compute log(N) powers of a, and then have to do atmost log(N) multiplications to get the final answer from them.
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since space used for the output is not counted towards the space complexity.

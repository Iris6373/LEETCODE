# Problem Statement

## [2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-three-consecutive-integers-that-sum-to-a-given-number/)


## 1) Math - OPTIMAL

     
  
        
   ### Code : (.cpp)  
      
          class Solution {
            public:
                vector<long long> sumOfThree(long long num) {
                    vector<long long> ans;
                    if (num%3) return ans;
                    long long b = num/3;
                    ans.push_back(b-1);
                    ans.push_back(b);
                    ans.push_back(b+1);
                    return ans;
                }
            };
  

    Time Complexity  : O(1)
                       Since we take constant time.
    Space Complexity : O(1)
                       Since no extra space is used.

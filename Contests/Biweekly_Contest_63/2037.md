# Problem

## [2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/)


# Solution 

## 1) Sorting - OPTIMAL
       
       Since we need to move each student to a different seat as given in 'a',
       we first sort 'a' and 'b' and count the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i].
    

   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
                  sort(a.begin(), a.end());
                  sort(b.begin(), b.end());
                  int ans = 0;
                  for (int i=0;i<a.size();i++) {
                      ans += abs(a[i]-b[i]);
                  } 
                  return ans;
              }
          };
    
    
    Time Complexity  : O(N*log(N))
                       Since we sort the arrays
    Space Complexity : O(1)
                       Since no extra space is used.

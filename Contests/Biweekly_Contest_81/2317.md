# Problem

## [2317. Maximum XOR After Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-after-operations/)


# Solution 

## 1) OR of all numbers - OPTIMAL

       Since nums[i] = to nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x) function can make the set bits in nums[i] to 0 and not vice versa.
       So, therefore we can make the sum of set bits of all numbers to be odd by using this function.
       So, the answer is ultimately the sum of powers of 2 of set bits, which OR of array.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int maximumXOR(vector<int>& nums) {
                  int ans = 0;
                  for (auto x : nums) ans |= x;
                  return ans;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse all the elements once
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

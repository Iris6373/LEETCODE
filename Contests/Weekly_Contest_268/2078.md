## [2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-furthest-houses-with-different-colors/)


# Solution 

## 1) Brute Force

       
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int maxDistance(vector<int>& colors) {
                  int i, j, n = colors.size(), ans = 0;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) 
                      for (j=i+1;j<n;j++) 
                          if (colors[i] != colors[j]) ans = max(ans,abs(i-j));
                  return ans;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N^2) 
                         Since we traverse in a nested loop
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.
                         
                         
## 2) Two Pointers - OPTIMAL

       The maximum out of last differing element from the 1st element and the 1st differing eleemnt from the last element is the answer.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
              public:
                  int maxDistance(vector<int>& colors) {
                      int i = 0, j = colors.size()-1, n = j+1;
                      while (colors[0] == colors[j]) j--;
                      while (colors[i] == colors[n-1]) i++;
                      return max(j, n-1-i);
                  }
              };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse in 2 loops
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

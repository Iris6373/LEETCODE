# Problem Statement

## [2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-reach-target-score/)


## 1) Reverse Process - OPTIMAL

     Multiplying the initial number by 2 and adding by 1 is same as dividing the final number by 2 and subtracting by 1.
     We do the reverse process by dividing by 2 when the curret number is divisible by 2 and d > 0 or subtract 1.
     
     If d == 0 and current number is not 1, we subtract the remaining to get 1.
  
        
   ### Code : (.cpp)  
      
          class Solution {
            public:
                int minMoves(int t, int d) {
                    int ans = 0;
                    while (t != 1) {
                        ans++;
                        if (d != 0 && t % 2 == 0) t /= 2, d--;
                        else t--;
                        if (d == 0) {
                            ans += (t-1);
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    return ans;
                }
            };


    Time Complexity  : O(D)
                       Since in worst case, we might have to divide the number by 2 until d > 0 and when d = 0, we immediately return the result.
    Space Complexity : O(1)
                       Since no extra space is used.

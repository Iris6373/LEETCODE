# Problem

## [662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/)


# Solution 

## 1) Level Order Traversal - OPTIMAL

       Since we need to keep track of the position of first and last node in a level, we use a technique
       to number the nodes of the tree like this :
                1
              2   3
            4  5 6  7..
       Using this technique, the answer is last-first+1.
       
       But the only problem here is, it will be lead to run-time error for skewed trees (the 1st node value is 2^3000-1).
       To counter this, we start the numbering process from 1 for every level.
       This can be done by subtracting the value of first node at that level.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
                  int i, ans = 1, lvl = 0;
                  queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> q;
                  q.push({root,1});
                  while (q.size()) {
                      int size = q.size(), first = INT_MIN, last = 0, mi = q.front().second;
                      while (size--) {
                          auto [x,y] = q.front();
                          y -= mi;
                          if (first == INT_MIN) first = y;
                          last = y;
                          q.pop();
                          if (x->left) q.push({x->left,2*y});
                          if (x->right) q.push({x->right,2*y+1});
                      }
                      ans = max(ans, last-first+1);
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse all the nodes once
      Space Complexity : O(N)
                         Since the maximum queue size can be width of tree - N

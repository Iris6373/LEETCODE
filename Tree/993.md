# Problem

## [993. Cousins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/)


# Solution 

## 1) Level Order Traversal - OPTIMAL

       To solve this question, we are going to use 6 variables,
            a, b - to indicate whether x and y is found or not.
            c, d - depth of x and y
            e, f - parents of x and y
            
       We perform normal BFS and in addition to that,
            we check if the root's left or right is x or y,
                  and if so, we change a or b to 1, store root->val as parent and its depth.
                  
       After traversing current level, we check if x or y is visited, 
            if so we check 3 conditions.
                  1. Both are visited, a == b  (to ensure they are in same level)
                  2. Both have same depth, c == d
                  3. Both have different parents, e != f
            if all are met, we return 1,
            else we return 0.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
                  bool a = 0, b = 0;
                  int c = 0, d = 0, e = 0, f = 0, depth = 0;
                  queue<TreeNode*> q;
                  q.push(root);
                  while (q.size()) {
                      int i, size = q.size();
                      for (i=0;i<size;i++) {
                          TreeNode* t = q.front();
                          q.pop();
                          if (t->left) {
                              q.push(t->left);
                              if (t->left->val == x) a = 1, c = depth, e = t->val;
                              if (t->left->val == y) b = 1, d = depth, f = t->val;
                          }
                          if (t->right) {
                              q.push(t->right);
                              if (t->right->val == x) a = 1, c = depth, e = t->val;
                              if (t->right->val == y) b = 1, d = depth, f = t->val;
                          }
                      }
                      depth++;
                      if (a || b) return a == b && c == d && e != f;
                  }
                  return 0;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse all the nodes once
      Space Complexity : O(N)
                         Since the maximum queue size can be width of tree - N

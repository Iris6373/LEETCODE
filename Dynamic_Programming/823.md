# Problem

## [823. Binary Trees With Factors](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-trees-with-factors/)


# Solution 

## 1) Bottom Up DP + Hash Table - OPTIMAL

       
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N^2) 
                         Since we traverse through a nested loop
      Space Complexity : O(N)
                         Since map is used.

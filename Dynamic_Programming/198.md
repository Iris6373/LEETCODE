# Solution 

## 1) DP - BOTTOM-UP APPROACH

     
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
                int i, a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, n = nums.size();
                for (i=n-1;i>=0;i--) {
                    c = max(nums[i]+a,b);
                    a = b;
                    b = c;
                }
                return c;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we traverse from n-1 to 0
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since no extra space is used

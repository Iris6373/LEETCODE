# Problem

## [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)


# Solution 

## 1) Using previously stored values

     
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> countBits(int n) {
                  vector<int> ans;
                  ans.push_back(0);
                  for (int i=1;i<=n;i*=2) for (int j=i;j<min(2*i,n+1);j++) ans.push_back(1+ans[j-i]);
                  return ans;
              }
          };


     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we traverse from 1 to n
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since we didn't use any extra space



## 2) [Bottom Up DP](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/discuss/1808016/C%2B%2B-oror-Vectors-Only-oror-Easy-To-Understand-oror-Full-Explanation)

     
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> countBits(int n) {
                  vector<int> ans(n+1,0);
                  for (int i=1;i<=n;i++) ans[i] = ans[i/2] + i%2;
                  return ans;
              }
          };


     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we traverse from 1 to n
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since we didn't use any extra space

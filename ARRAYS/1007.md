## [1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/)


# Solution 

## 1) GREEDY APPROACH - 1

      Since, the value ranges from 1 to 6 (i), we can simply iterate from 1 to 6 and check the following conditions :
          1) If a[j] != i and b[j] != i, we continue with next i
          2) If a[j] == i, x++
          3) If b[j] == i, y++
          
          Next we store the minimum value 
      
          
          
      Time Complexity  : O(6*N) -> O(N) 
                         Since we traverse through the array '6' times
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no auxillary space is used.

## [598. Range Addition II](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/)


# Solution          
                
## 1) One Pass - OPTIMAL

    As a base case, if the given 2D array is empty, then all elements are equal (0), then we return m*n.
    Let's initialize a = m and b = n.
    Now, by traversing the array,
        We take a = minimum of a and v[i][0] and b = minimum of b and v[i][1].
        This logic works because, the rectangle is formed from (0,0) upto (v[i][0],v[i][1]).
        Thus, the result matrix is always on the top-left of the origional matrix, 
        so what we need to do is to find the intersection of matrixs in the list.
    
    
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& v) {
                  int i, j, a = m, b = n;
                  if (v.size() == 0) return m*n;
                  for (i=0;i<v.size();i++) {
                      a = min(a,v[i][0]);
                      b = min(b,v[i][1]);
                  }
                  return a*b;
              }
          };
    
    
    Time Complexity  : O(M*N) 
                         Since we only traverse throught the matrix once
    Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used

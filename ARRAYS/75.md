# Problem

## [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)


# Solution 

## 1) Count number of 0's, 1's and 2's and reassign them  - BETTER

      
     First, we traverse the array to count the number of 0's, 1's and 2's.
     Then in another traversal, we reassign those 0's, 1's and 2's
        
        
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we linearly traverse two times
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since no auxillary space is used.
   
   
   
## 2) Dutch National Flag Algorithm - OPTIMAL

      
     Let zero and one be assigned as 0 and two as n-1
     
     The algorithm is as follows :
          While (one <= two)
              If (v[one] == 0)
                  swap(v[zero],v[one])
                  zero++
                  one++
              Else if (v[one] == 1)
                  one++
              Else
                  swap(v[one],v[two])
                  two--
        
      This algorithm allows us to sort the array in just one traversal without any extra space 
     
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
      class Solution {
      public:
          void sortColors(vector<int>& v) {
              int i, n = v.size(), zero = 0, one = 0, two = n-1;
              while (one <= two) {
                  if (v[one] == 0) swap(v[zero++],v[one++]);
                  else if (v[one] == 1) one++;
                  else swap(v[one],v[two--]);
              }
          }
      };

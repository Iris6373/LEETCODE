# Problem Statement

## [997. Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)


## 1) Hash Table - OPTIMAL

     The judge does not trust anybody and everyone except him trusts the judge (n-1).
     So, we can maintain a map which counts the no. of trusts.
     If a person trusts other person, he can definitely be not a judge. Top indicate that, we decrease the map count by 1.
     So, that he can never n-1 trusts.
     And we add 1 to person trusts[i][1].
       
     Thus, if there is a person with n-1 trusts, we return him.
     Else -1.
  
        
   ### Code : (.cpp)  
      
          class Solution {
          public:
              int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
                  int i, ans = 0;
                  unordered_map<int,int> a;
                  for (auto v : trust) a[v[0]]--, a[v[1]]++;
                  for (i=1;i<=n;i++) if (a[i] == n-1) return i;
                  return -1;
              }
          };


    Time Complexity  : O(N)
                       Since the insert operation takes O(1) for unordered_map on average. 

    Space Complexity : O(N)
                       Since a map is used.

# Problem

## [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
 

# Solution 

## 1) Sorting + Greedy - OPTIMAL
      
    Initially, we add the first pair to 'ans'.
    Next in a loop, we check 
        If the first element of current pair in 'v' is greater than or
        equal to second element of last pair in 'ans', we merge those intervals by taking 
        minimum of the first elements and maximum of second elements.
        Else we add the current pair to 'ans'
    
    
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& v) {
                sort(v.begin(), v.end());
                int i, n = v.size(), a = 0;
                vector<vector<int>> ans;
                ans.push_back(v[0]);
                for (i=1;i<n;i++) {
                    if (v[i][0] <= ans[a][1]) {
                        ans[a][0] = min(ans[a][0],v[i][0]);
                        ans[a][1] = max(ans[a][1],v[i][1]);
                    }
                    else ans.push_back(v[i]), a++;
                }
                return ans;
            }
        };
        
    
    Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                       Since whole array is traversed 
    Space Complexity : O(1)
                       Since input/output array is not considered as extra space.

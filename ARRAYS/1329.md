# Problem

[1329. Sort the Matrix Diagonally](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-matrix-diagonally/)


# Solution     
                
## 1) BRUTE FORCE - OPTIMAL

    We simply add all the elements of every diagonal into a vector and sort it.
    After sorting, we assign them into the matrix.
    
    The diagonals below the main daigonal is sorted first, followed the other diagonals.
    It can be done in the reverse order too.
    
    
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<vector<int>> diagonalSort(vector<vector<int>>& v) {
                  int i, j, k, x, y, a, m = v.size(), n = v[0].size();
                  y = 0;
                  for (k=m-1;k>=0;k--) {
                      vector <int> diag;
                      i = k;
                      j = 0;
                      while (i < m && j < n) {
                          diag.push_back(v[i++][j++]);
                      }
                      i = k;
                      j = 0;
                      a = 0;
                      sort(diag.begin(), diag.end());
                      while (a < diag.size()) {
                          v[i++][j++] = diag[a++];
                      }
                  }
                  for (k=0;k<n;k++) {
                      vector <int> diag;
                      i = 0;
                      j = k;
                      while (i < m && j < n) {
                          diag.push_back(v[i++][j++]);
                      }
                      i = 0;
                      j = k;
                      a = 0;
                      sort(diag.begin(), diag.end());
                      while (a < diag.size()) {
                          v[i++][j++] = diag[a++];
                      }
                  }
                  return v;
              }
          };
    
    
    Time Complexity  : O(M*N) 
                       Since we traverse through the entire matrix twice
    Space Complexity : O(N)
                       Since a vector is used for sorting diagonals

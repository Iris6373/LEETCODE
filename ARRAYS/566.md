# Problem

[566. Reshape the Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/)


# Solution 

## 1) NESTED LOOP - OPTIMAL

     First, we check the base conditon.
     If m*n != r*c, then new matrix cannot be formed (as the number of elements are not equal)
     
     If they are equal, we iterate through every element of v and assign to ans.
     If column value of ans reaches 'c', we increment r and make b = 0
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& v, int r, int c) {
                int i, j, a = 0, b = 0, m = v.size(), n = v[0].size();
                if (m*n != r*c) return v;
                vector<vector<int>> ans(r, vector<int>(c,0));
                for (i=0;i<m;i++) {
                    for (j=0;j<n;j++) {
                        if (b == c) a++, b = 0;
                        ans[a][b++] = v[i][j];
                    }
                }
                return ans;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(M*N) 
                        Since we traverse through the matrix
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since space used for the output is not counted towards the space complexity.
        


## 2) SINGLE LOOP - OPTIMAL

     Same as ladst approach, except we use a single loop to assign values by using this method,
        ans[i/c][i%c] = v[i/n][i%n]
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& v, int r, int c) {
                int i, j, a = 0, b = 0, m = v.size(), n = v[0].size();
                if (m*n != r*c) return v;
                vector<vector<int>> ans(r, vector<int>(c,0));
                for (i=0;i<m*n;i++) ans[i/c][i%c] += v[i/n][i%n];
                return ans;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(M*N) 
                        Since we traverse through the matrix
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since space used for the output is not counted towards the space complexity.

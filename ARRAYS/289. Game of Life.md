# Problem

[289. Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/)


# Solution 

## 1) NAIVE APPROACH

      Calculate number of live neighbours in a variable, say x
      If current cell is live 
          If x = [2,3], it remains live (remains 1)
          Else it dies (turns into 0) 
      If current cell is dead
          If x == 3, it turns into a live cell (turns into 1)
          Else remain dead (remains 0)
          
      Since we cannot update the current cell and use for further operations, we store it in a 2-D matrix
          
          
      Time Complexity  : O(M*N) 
                         Since we traverse through each and every cell in the matrix
      Space Complexity : O(M*N)
                         Since we use a matrix of size M*N to store the updated matrix
                         
                         
                         
## 2) OPTIMAL APPROACH

      Instead of storing the updated values in an another matrix, we follow this logic :
          If the current cell is live and (x > 3 or x < 2), we assign 2 to it.
              This is to indicate that this cell is alive in the current state and will be dead in the future state
          If the current cell is dead and x == 3, we assign -1 to it.
              This is to indicate that this cell is dead in the current state and will be alive in the future state
              
      After traversing the matrix once and updating according to the conditions, 
      we traverse again to change the cells with value '2' to '0' and '-1' to '1'.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& v) {
                  int i, j, m=v.size(), n=v[0].size();
                  for (i=0;i<m;i++) {
                      for (j=0;j<n;j++) {
                          int a = 0;
                          if (i-1 >= 0) {
                              if (v[i-1][j] >= 1) a++;
                              if (j-1 >= 0 && v[i-1][j-1] >= 1) a++;
                              if (j+1 < n && v[i-1][j+1] >= 1) a++;
                          }
                          if (j-1 >= 0 && v[i][j-1] >= 1) a++;
                          if (j+1 < n && v[i][j+1] >= 1) a++;
                          if (i+1 < m) {
                              if (v[i+1][j] >= 1) a++;
                              if (j-1 >= 0 && v[i+1][j-1] >= 1) a++;
                              if (j+1 < n && v[i+1][j+1] >= 1) a++;
                          }
                          if (v[i][j] == 1) {
                              if (a < 2 || a > 3) v[i][j] = 2;
                          }
                          else {
                              if (a == 3) v[i][j] = -1;
                          }   
                      }
                  }
                  for (i=0;i<m;i++) {
                      for (j=0;j<n;j++) {
                          if (v[i][j] == 2) v[i][j] = 0;
                          else if (v[i][j] == -1) v[i][j] = 1;
                      }
                  }
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(M*N) 
                         Since we traverse through each and every cell in the matrix
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since we only modify the input matrix and no auxillary space is used

# Problem

## [41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)


# Solution 

## 1) Swapping array elements - OPTIMAL

      If the value at the index is greater than 0 and v[i] <= n, we swap the elements at the positions v[v[i]-1] and v[i].
      We perform this operation until v[i] != i+1 and v[v[i]-1] != v[i]-1
      We iterate through the entire array until the above conditions are satisfied.

      The index which are not equal to their value is the first missing positive integer. 
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& v) {
                  int i, n = v.size();
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                      while (v[i] > 0 && v[i] <= n && v[i] != v[v[i]-1] && v[i] != i+1) 
                          swap(v[i], v[v[i]-1]); 
                  }
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) if (v[i] != i+1) return i+1;
                  return n+1;
              }
          };
          
          // Fast I/O
          static bool     _foo = ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
          static ostream* _bar = cin.tie(NULL);

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse through the array twice
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since we only modify the input matrix and no auxillary space is used

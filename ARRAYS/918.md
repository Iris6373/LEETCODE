# Problem

## [918. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/)


# Solution 

## 1) Kadane's Algorithm - OPTIMAL

       The max subarray is either the one which lies entirely inside the array or
       which lies part left ans part right.
       
       The 1st case can be solved using regular Kadane's algorithm.
       The 2nd case however can also be solved using it by finding the minimum sum subarray.
       If we want to find the max subarray part left ans part right, we can find the min subarray inside 
       and subtract it from total sum and compare with the 1st case ans.
      
       The only edge case here is if all numbers are negative, in which case the ans will be 0 since total == min_sum.
       So, if that's the case, we return 1st ans.
       
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int maxSubarraySumCircular(vector<int>& nums) {
                  int val1 = 0, ans1 = nums[0], val2 =0, ans2 = nums[0], sum = 0;
                  for (int z : nums) {
                      sum += z;
                      val1 = max(val1+z, z);
                      ans1 = max(ans1, val1);
                      val2 = min(val2+z, z);
                      ans2 = min(ans2, val2);
                  }
                  return ans1 > 0 ? max(ans1, sum-ans2) : ans1;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse all the elements once
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

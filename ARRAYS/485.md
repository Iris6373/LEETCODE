# Problem

## [485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)


# Solution 


## 1) Generic Linear Travesal - OPTIMAL

      We simply traverse through the array and add 1 to curr if current element is 1.
      If the current element is 0, we assign curr to ans if the current ans is less than curr and assign curr = 0.
     
     
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
          class Solution {
          public:
              int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& a) {
                  int n = a.size(), i, ans = 0, curr = 0;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                      if (a[i] == 1) curr++;
                      else {
                          ans = max(ans, curr);
                          curr = 0;
                      }
                  }
                  ans = max(ans, curr);
                  return ans;
              }
          };
          
          
       Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse through the array once
       Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no auxillary space is used.

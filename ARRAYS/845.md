# Problem

## [845. Longest Mountain in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/)


# Solution 

## 1) PEAKS and VALLEYS - OPTIMAL

       We check if there exits peak and valley at the same time, first increasing and then decreasing and record the maximum answer possible.
       One edge is equal numbers, which we ignore by traversing to next element until they are not same.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
            public:
                int longestMountain(vector<int>& arr) {
                    int i = 1, j, peak, valley, n = arr.size(), ans = 0;
                    while (i < n) {
                        j = i-1, peak = 0, valley = 0;
                        while (i < n && arr[i-1] < arr[i]) peak = 1, i++;
                        while (i < n && arr[i-1] > arr[i]) valley = 1, i++;
                        if (peak && valley && (i-j) > 2) ans = max(ans, i-j);
                        while (i < n && arr[i-1] == arr[i]) i++;
                    }
                    ans = max(ans, j-i);
                    return ans;
                }
            };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse all the nodes twice
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

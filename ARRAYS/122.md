# Solution 

## 1) Greedy - OPTIMAL

       
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
                  int i, n = prices.size(), curr = 0, ans = 0;
                  for (i=1;i<n;i++) {
                      if (prices[curr] < prices[i]) ans += prices[i] - prices[curr];
                      curr = i;
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since it is just one-pass
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.

# Problem

## [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)


# Solution 

## 1) SORTING + HASHMAP - OPTIMAL

     First, we store the frequrncies of each character in a vector of pairs.
     Then, we sort this vector in decreasing order.
     Finally, we add the characters w.r.t their frequencies.
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            string frequencySort(string s) {
                int i, n = s.size();
                map <char,int> mp;
                for (char c : s) mp[c]++;
                vector <pair<int,char>> vp;
                for (auto z : mp) vp.push_back({z.second, z.first});
                s = "";
                sort(vp.rbegin(), vp.rend());
                for (auto z : vp) {
                    for (i=0;i<z.first;i++) s += (string) "" + z.second;
                }
                return s;
            }
        };

     
     Time Complexity  : O(N*lo(N)) 
                        Since sorting and map insertion of N elements take linarithmetic time
     Space Complexity : O(N)
                        Since a vector and map is used for counting frequency

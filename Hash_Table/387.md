## [387. First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)


# Solution 

## 1) SORTING + HASHMAP - OPTIMAL

     We store the frequrncies of each character in a vector.
     And and run through the string again to compare the current character and it's frequency.
     If it is 1, we retunr it's index
     Else, we return -1.
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int firstUniqChar(string s) {
                vector<int> v(26,0);
                int i, ans = -1, n = s.size();
                for (i=0;i<n;i++) v[s[i]-'a']++;
                for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                    if (v[s[i]-'a'] == 1) {
                        ans = i;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                return ans;
            }
        };

     
     Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                        Since we go through the string of length N two times.
     Space Complexity : O(1)
                        Since the number of alphabets is constant (26)

# Problem

## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
  
 
# Solution 

## 1) Nested Loops - NAIVE APPROACH

      We use a nested loop to find the indices that upto the target.
          
      Time Complexity  : O(N^2) 
                         Since we use 2 nested loops to find the answer 
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no auxillary space is used
                         
                         
                         
## 2) Hash Table - OPTIMAL APPROACH

      Instead of finding the right pair that adds upto the target, we first store the value of index of all elements in a map.
      Then we traverse through the array to find if t-v[i] is present in the map or not.
      Finally, we return the answer
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& v, int t) {
                  int j, n = v.size(), i;
                  unordered_map <int, int> m;
                  vector <int> ans;
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                      m[v[i]] = i;
                  }
                  for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                      if (m[t-v[i]] != 0 && i != m[t-v[i]]) {
                          ans.push_back(i);
                          ans.push_back(m[t-v[i]]);
                          return ans;
                      }
                  }
                  return ans;
              }
          };

 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse through each and every element in the array
      Space Complexity : O(N)
                         Since a map is used to store the array elements

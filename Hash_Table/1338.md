## [1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://leetcode.com/problems/reduce-array-size-to-the-half/)


# Solution 

## 1) SORTING + HASH TABLE

     Inorder to know which element to remove, we need it's frequency.
     Thus, we count frequency of each integer in a map and assign it to a vector.
     
     Since, we need to remove atleast 'n/2' elements, we need elements with higher frequency.
     So, we sort the 'freq' vector in decreasing order and keep adding the frequency of the integers 
     until we remove at least half of the integers.
       
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int minSetSize(vector<int>& v) {
                int i, n = v.size(), ans = 0, rem = 0;
                vector<int> freq;
                map <int, int> mp;
                for (i=0;i<n;i++) mp[v[i]]++;
                for (auto z : mp) freq.push_back(z.second);
                sort(freq.begin(), freq.end(), greater<int>());
                i = 0;
                for (i=0;i<freq.size();i++) {
                    if (rem >= n/2) break;
                    rem += freq[i];
                }
                return i;
            }
        };
     
     
     Time Complexity  : O(N*log(N)) 
                        Since sorting and map insertion of N elements take linarithmetic time
     Space Complexity : O(N)
                        Since a vector and map is used for counting frequency

# Problem

## [1726. Tuple with Same Product](https://leetcode.com/problems/tuple-with-same-product/)


# Solution 

## 1) Different Products in Hash Table - OPTIMAL

     First, we store the different possible products that can be formed
     by any pair of elements in the array.
     
     Then, we add 8*(freq)*(freq-1)/2 to ans.
     This is because we can represent 2 pairs in 8 ways.
     And (freq)*(freq-1)/2 is because 'freq' pairs can form those many combinations.
     
       
   ### Code (.cpp)
   
        class Solution {
        public:
            int tupleSameProduct(vector<int>& v) {
                int i, j, n = v.size(), ans = 0;
                unordered_map <int,int> mp;
                for (i=0;i<n-1;i++) {
                    for (j=i+1;j<n;j++) {
                        mp[v[i]*v[j]]++;
                    }
                }
                for (auto z : mp) {
                    ans += 4*(z.second)*(z.second-1);
                }
                return ans;
            }
        };


     Time Complexity  : O(N^2) 
                        Since we a nested loop to calculate products
     Space Complexity : O(N)
                        Since a map is used for counting frequency

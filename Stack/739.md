# Problem

## [739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)


# Solution 

## 1) Using Monotonic Stack - OPTIMAL

      First, we assign the 'ans' with zeroes and add first element and its index 0 to the stack 'st'.
      
      Our goal is to assign ans[i], the index of the temperature that is just greater than the current day.
      Inorder to know about the upcoming days temperature for processing the current day, we push the current day 
      temperature in the stack.
      
      Next, we compare if the current day temperature is greater the top of the stack.
      If it is true, we assign ans[index of top in stack] = current index - index of top in stack
      
      While the aboce the condition is true and the stack is not empty, we continue this process.
      
      Once, we process the entire array, stack may contain some temperatures which are still not processed.
      This means that those temperatures do not have any greater temperatures than them in the future, 
      for which we should assign 0 and it is already done when we initialized all of 'ans' to 0 . 
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
            class Solution {
            public:
                vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temp) {
                    int i, n = temp.size();
                    vector<int> ans(n,0);
                    stack<pair<int,int>> st;
                    st.push({temp[0],0});
                    for (i=1;i<n;i++) {
                        while (!st.empty()) {
                            auto p = st.top();
                            int f = p.first, s = p.second;
                            if (f < temp[i]) {
                                ans[s] = i-s;
                                st.pop();
                            } 
                            else break;
                        }
                        st.push({temp[i],i});
                    }
                    return ans;
                }
            };
            
            
 
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we traverse through the array
      Space Complexity : O(N)
                         Since the maximum size of stack can be N

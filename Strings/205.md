# Problem

## [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)


# Solution 

## 1) Mapping character to another using Hashing

      Inorder to know the character to which the original character is decoded, we use a vector (u)
      which stores the original character's ASCII value and a vector (v) which stores the decoded character's ASCII value.
      
      So, when we encounter a new character which was not encoded before and the encoded charcter is not 
      used to any other character before, we store their ASCII values in the corresponding vectors.
      
      Else if the character is already decoded, we continue.
      
      Else we return false
      
      If the two strings satisfy the first 2 conditions, then we return true. 
      

   ### Code : (.cpp)
      
            class Solution {
            public:
                bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
                    int i, j, n = s.size();
                    vector <int> u(128,-1), v(128,-1);
                    for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
                        int a = (int)s[i], b = (int)t[i];
                        // cout << a << " " << v[a] << "\t" << b << " " << v[b] << "\t"
                        if (v[a] == b && u[b] == a) continue;
                        else if (v[a] == -1 && u[b] == -1) {
                            v[a] = b;
                            u[b] = a;
                        }
                        else return 0;
                    }
                    return 1;
                }
            };


      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we iterate through all charcters of the string
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since the length of the vectors is 128, O(128) -> O(1)

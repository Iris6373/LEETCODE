# Problem

[1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)

# Solution 

## 1) NAIVE APPROACH - Using stack

      We can use a stack to keep track of the characters
      
      Push a character if,
          (i)  Stack is empty
          (ii) Top element is not same as current character in the string
      Pop if they are equal
      
      After this process, pop all characters and reverse them to get the result.
      
      
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we iterate through all charcters of the string
      Space Complexity : O(N)
                         Since we use a stack to store characters
                         Worst-case = Can store all characters
          
      
      
## 2) OPTIMAL - Two Pointers

      i - points to last character of the result
      j - points to the current character of the input string
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
      
          class Solution {
          public:
              string removeDuplicates(string s) {
                  int i=0, j;
                  for (j=1;j<s.size();j++) {
                      if (i < 0 || s[i] != s[j]) s[++i] = s[j];
                      else i--;
                  }
                  return s.substr(0,i+1);
              }
          };


      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we iterate through all charcters of the string
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no auxillary space is used.

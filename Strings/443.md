# Problem

## [443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)


# Solution 

## 1) Normal Inplementation - OPTIMAL

      We implement as given in the question.
      We use 'j' as our pointer to the last element in the modified array.
      Once, new character is found, we append the old character and its frequency.
      
      Atlast, we need to add the last character, as it won't be added in the loop.
      

   ### Code : (.cpp)
      
          class Solution {
          public:
              int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
                  int i, j = 0, k, n = chars.size(), num = 1;
                  char ch = chars[0];
                  for (i=1;i<n;i++) {
                      if (chars[i] != chars[i-1]) {
                          if (num > 1) {
                              int a = num, len = 0;
                              while (a > 0) a /= 10, len++;
                              chars[j] = ch;
                              for (k=j+len;k>j;k--) chars[k] = '0'+num%10, num /= 10; 
                              j += len;
                          }
                          else {
                              chars[j] = ch;
                          }
                          j++;
                          ch = chars[i];
                          num = 1;  
                      }
                      else num++;
                  }
                  int a, len = 0;
                  if (num > 1) {
                      a = num, len = 0;
                      while (a > 0) a /= 10, len++;
                      chars[j] = ch;
                      for (k=j+len;k>j;k--) chars[k] = '0'+num%10, num /= 10; 
                  }
                  else chars[j] = ch;
                  num = j+len+1;
                  while (num < n) chars.pop_back(), num++;
                  return chars.size();
              }
          };
      
      
      Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                         Since we iterate through each character in chars
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since we didn't use any extra space

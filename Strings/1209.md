# Problem

### [1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)


# Solution 

    We can use a stack of pairs to store the current character and number of its occurrences.
    If the number of occurrences of 'ch' is not equal to 'k' and we encounter a different character in the string, 
    we push {ch,a} to the stack.

    After processing the string, if the number of occurrences of 'ch' is not zero, we push {ch,a} to the stack.

    We initialize s to an empty string.
    Then we add each charcater to s, according to the frequencies.

    Finally, we reverse s (as stack gives the reverse order while popping) and return s.
  
  
  ### Code : (.cpp)
  
        class Solution {
        public:
            string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
                int i=0, j, a=1;
                stack <pair<char,int>> st;
                char ch = s[0];
                for (i=1;i<s.size();i++) {
                    if (s[i] != ch) {
                        st.push({ch,a});
                        a = 1;
                        ch = s[i];
                    }
                    else {
                        a++;
                        if (a == k) {
                            if (!st.empty()) {
                                auto z = st.top();
                                ch = z.first;
                                a = z.second;
                                st.pop();
                            } 
                            else {
                                ch = '0';
                                a = 0;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (a != 0) st.push({ch,a});
                s = "";
                while (!st.empty()) {
                    auto z = st.top();
                    ch = z.first;
                    a = z.second;
                    while (a--) s += (string)"" + ch;
                    st.pop();
                }
                reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
                return s;
            }
        };

  
  
    Time Complexity  : O(N) 
                       Since we traverse through each and every character in the string
    Space Complexity : O(N)
                       Since we use a stack to keep track of new charcaters and their frequencies

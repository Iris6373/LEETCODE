# Problem

## [463. Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)


# Solution 

## 1) Comparing only nearby Neighbours - OPTIMAL

      Only sides of a land can contribute to the perimter, so we only consider lands.
      One side of a land can contribute to the perimter if and only if it does not share its side any with another land.
      
      Thus, we check for all 4 directions with possible neighbours and compute the perimeter.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          class Solution {
          public:
              int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
                  int i, j, row = grid.size(), col = grid[0].size(), per = 0;
                  for (i=0;i<row;i++) {
                      for (j=0;j<col;j++) {
                          if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                              per += 4;
                              if (i-1 >= 0 && grid[i-1][j] == 1) per--;
                              if (i+1 < row && grid[i+1][j] == 1) per--;
                              if (j-1 >= 0 && grid[i][j-1] == 1) per--;
                              if (j+1 < col && grid[i][j+1] == 1) per--;
                          }
                      }
                  }
                  return per;
              }
          };
          

      Time Complexity  : O(4*M*N) -> O(M*N) 
                         Since we traverse through the entire matrix and every element 4 times during DFS
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no auxillary space is used
